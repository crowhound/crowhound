# Important note for anyone looking at my profile during the weeks of November 10th and Novemeber 17th.
TLDR:  Currently updating project repos and made some private just while syncing their new documentation. They will be made public again on a per repo basis when the documentation sync is done. 
This includes my personal Linkedin and studio Twitter. I will be updating them a lot because most of my profile updates was on the main organization community linkedin that is private for community members part of the tool brain storming and QA team. 

Non-TLDR: I am currently overhauling my portfolio projects, project repos, and a developer website I have been preparing to release that has educational material for software developers that is useful for multiple coding languages, web frameworks, and game engines. A lot of repos were made private for a short period of time while I clean up the repo read me section and add the first set of documentation.
The repos are split between the organization account for Shatter Fantasy Tools being released as open source software for all Unity devs to use for free and my personal GitHub profile (this profile).
You will see some forks of the Shatter Fantasy Tool repos here that are just meant as a way to show repos I am working on, but all code commits will be done on the Shatter Fantasy Tool repos.
I will also be updating my personal Linkedin and the studio Twitter with the stuff I have been working on. Most updates were part of the private brain storming and QA testing community for the Shatter Fantasy Tools.

## Unity Open Source Community Tools:
Currently I am working on a set of free packages to use with Unity to help make development easier for all members of the community. 
These are going to be open source for the community. Please note all the below tools is currently in pre-alpha, so not even alpha 1. 
We just finalized the roadmap for the first five alphas for all the packages and we finalized the documentation process on the week of November 10, 2024.
They will have documentation and an updated read me for easy install instructions via Unity's package manager added within the week of November 10, 2024.
All of them are currently usable even in pre-alpha state, but they should only be used in Unity 2023.2 or newer. 
This requirement is mostly due to not wanting to waste resources maintaining legacy UI Toolkit and Scriptable Render Pipeline code that was removed completely in Unity in 2023.2 and Unity 6.1.

## Warning for the two very big and growing linked below Unity packages! 250 C# scripts and growing.
The SF Sprite Tools and the SF Platformer packages are currently in an unstable state due to a recent update we are pushing for the last pre-alpha before alpha one release.
They are super early pre-alphas currently in the works and can throw errors.

The SF Platformer pre-alpha 8 was already used to almost fully remake Super Mario World and Super Metroid for the SNES as tests. 
We added a couple things in the current pre-alpha 9 that are waiting to have the Command Controller and it's custom editor to be pushed.
There will be errors till we finish the last test for the Command Controller the week of November 10th for the SF Platformer.

They are both on my personal GitHub, but once in better shape they both will be moved to the Shatter Fantasy main organization GitHub repos.
These packages are already very big with already over 250 seperate C# scripts. I still got like 50 more uncommitted files to do some testing in the SF Platformer.
Test both them in a new project. Do not use either pre-alpha package in a project that already exists till it is more stable.
They are both the biggest packages I am currently in charge of working on.
Read the install instructions carefully that are located in the read me at the following link. There is no documentation on it yet. To open the SF Sprite Editor look for the top menu bar menu for SF Tools.

### Recent Self-Learning 
Combine the things I already knew about DocFX and GitHub Actions to auto generate C# and .net documentation for projects and tools API for users to read through.
DocFX is used to generate YAML, markdown, and HTML files from a set of C# and .net files. 
GitHub Actions is used to auomatically publish the documentation to a website for people to visit and learn from. 

Example link for the result of the very first test. Due note that I haven't set up the manual for the documentation to be generated yet and I need to add some descriptions to the properties.
Second link is to the GitHub Action code that I used to generate the documentation. I will make an example page on how to set up the config file soon for people wanting to generate documentation themselves.
This second link is part of the work in progres Shatter Fantasy UI Elements community tools. It is not even Alpha release 1 yet, but it is usable with a bit of UI Toolkit functionality.

### Live Coding Self Learning Streams:
Every so often I do self-learning live streams or just testing out different ways to do stuff I already know how to do. 
These live streams will have me fumbling around as I try to learn new things or improve on stuff while streaming.
For anyone watching please keep in mind since I am doing self learning I might get stuck on certain areas for stuff I am learning from scratch.
These streams are meant to be a source of learning new developer techniques and to improve my skills.

### Discord Community Server:
Currently I am working on creating a small Discord server to allow people to discuss things they would like to see added in the community packages. This is a WIP and be ready within the next few months.
