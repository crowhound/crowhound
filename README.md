### Free Stuff:
Currently I am working on a set of free packages to use with Unity to help make development easier for all members of the community. When the first set of packages are ready I will add the links here. 

### Discord Community Server:
Currently I am working on creating a small Discord server to allow people to discuss things they would like to see added in the community packages. This is a WIP and be ready within the next few months. 

### Social Connections:
If anyone wants to see me make stuff on stream and ask for requests or ask any questions, they can found me live on one of the following channels.
Currently streaming on Twitch while making some Unity Editor tools for a Metroidvania.

### Want To Support Future Community Tools.
For anyone wanting to support me, when I release the first set of public tools for the community you can donate on Ko-Fi.
