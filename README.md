### Free Stuff:

Currently I am working on a set of free packages to use with Unity to help make development easier for all members of the community. When the first set of packages are ready I will add the links here. 


### Discord Community Server:
Currently I am working on creating a small Discord server to allow people to discuss things they would like to see added in the community packages. Anyone is allowed to join it. It is new and currently still being worked on.
