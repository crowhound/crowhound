### Unity Open Source Community Tools:
Currently I am working on a set of free packages to use with Unity to help make development easier for all members of the community. 
These are going to be open source for the community. Please note all the below tools is currently in pre-alpha, so not even alpha 1. 
We just finalized the roadmap for the first five alphas for all the packages and we finalized the documentation process on the week of November 10, 2024.
They will have documentation and an updated read me for easy install instructions via Unity's package manager added within the week of November 10, 2024.
All of them are currently usable even in pre-alpha state, but they should only be used in Unity 2023.2 or newer. 
This requirement is mostly due to not wanting to waste resources maintaining legacy UI Toolkit and Scriptable Render Pipeline code that was removed completely in Unity in 2023.2 and Unity 6.1

### Recent Self-Learning 
Combine the things I already knew about DocFX and GitHub Actions to auto generate C# and .net documentation for projects and tools API for users to read through.
DocFX is used to generate YAML, markdown, and HTML files from a set of C# and .net files. 
GitHub Actions is used to auomatically publish the documentation to a website for people to visit and learn from. 

Example link for the result of the very first test. Due note that I haven't set up the manual for the documentation to be generated yet and I need to add some descriptions to the properties.
Second link is to the GitHub Action code that I used to generate the documentation. I will make an example page on how to set up the config file soon for people wanting to generate documentation themselves.
This second link is part of the work in progres Shatter Fantasy UI Elements community tools. It is not even Alpha release 1 yet, but it is usable with a bit of UI Toolkit functionality.

### Live Coding Self Learning Streams:
Every so often I do self-learning live streams or just testing out different ways to do stuff I already know how to do. 
These live streams will have me fumbling around as I try to learn new things or improve on stuff while streaming.
For anyone watching please keep in mind since I am doing self learning I might get stuck on certain areas for stuff I am learning from scratch.
These streams are meant to be a source of learning new developer techniques and to improve my skills.

### Discord Community Server:
Currently I am working on creating a small Discord server to allow people to discuss things they would like to see added in the community packages. This is a WIP and be ready within the next few months.
