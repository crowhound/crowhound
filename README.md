# Important to anyone reading this in June 2025.
I am currently updating the repos read me, adding images, manuals, and videos for tutorials. 
If you see some sections that looked complete, I might be currently working on it.

## Reminder for the SF Unity packages:
The packages are just preparing for early Alpha releases. Somethings will have code updates from alpha release to alpha release that might cause breaking API changes.
There are a couple bugs we know about and some of them are related to a Unity Engine bug that a lead dev at Unity has already found a fix for and is going already through QA in early June.


## Updates to community repos
The SF Platformer package is being updated in the Shatter Fantasy organization's SF-Metroidvania repo at the moment.
After the SF Metroidvania reaches the next major milestone the updates for the SF PLatformer will be merged into the SF Platformer repo as a standalone tool.

The SF Metroidvania package has a lot more than just the SF Platformer features. It has been heavily updated with a lot of features. 
The feature list will be added to the SF Metroidvania readme and manual pages little over time. Currently the recordings for video documentation is my priority. 
There is a lot more medium and small features in it, but will mention them on the dedicated page for it located at the following link.

## Self Learning Repos
Current self-learning repo is not public yet. Below is the prevous one. 
Currently making the standalone water tool for Unity in URP, so it can be dragged and dropped into any Unity 6 or newer version that is using URP.
Special thanks to Andre McGrail (Verasl) and Brendan Duncan for providing a great learning resource to start with for Gerstner Waves in Unity's Boat-Attack demo project.

There are several repos here, that are for self-learning and trying out new things. I will start marking the top of the read me section with a label saying self-learning repo that also says the current progress of it.
My current work in progress self-learning repo is a multithreading Unity project. It is a small real time strategy game meant to test out moving, selecting, and giving commands to game units using mutlithreading code.

### SF Platformer Unity community package
Development was shifted to the SF-Metroidvania package.
After the next major release the updates will be merged into the SF-Platformer package, but right now the SF-Metrdoivania package is where a lot of the development is.
It has a vast amount of improvements for physics, camera systems, and a lot more.

> [!WARNING]
> The SF Sprite Tools package are currently in very experimental testing. 
> It is in early pre-alpha currently and can throw errors in rare cases  when using the multi sprite editing tool for creating animations. <br/>
>Test the SF Sprite Tools in a new project. Do not use the pre-alpha package in a project that already exists till it is more stable.
>Read the install instructions carefully that are located in the read me at the following link.
>There is no documentation on it yet. To open the SF Sprite Editor look for the top menu bar menu for SF/2D/Sprite Editor.

### Other Recent Self-Learning 
Last self learning projects were aimed at combining the things I already knew about DocFX and GitHub Actions to auto generate C# and .net documentation for projects and tools API for users to read through.
DocFX is used to generate YAML, markdown, and HTML files from a set of C# and .net files. 
GitHub Actions is used to auomatically publish the documentation to a website for people to visit and learn from. 

Example link for the current SF Metroidvania API documentation. Do note that I haven't set up the manual for the documentation or the home page yet. At the moment the home page mirrors the default read me file for packages.
Second link is to the GitHub Action code that I used to generate the documentation. I will make an example page on how to set up the config file later for people wanting to generate documentation themselves.
